            <p>Let's talk a little bit about myself. My full name is Huyen Thi Nguyen. But I prefer people to call me Lina or Nhi and, I am 20 years old now. I come
                from Vietnam and I have gone in the UK almost a year. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam" target="_blank"> About Vietnam.</a> <br></p>

     <h1> Education</h1>
     <p>I did foundation course majoring in Law, Business and Society at Kaplan, University of
        the west of England, international college. I wanted to be a lawyer in the future. However, there are several reasons made me change my decision at the end. Now, as you all know, I am studying Digital Media. I have know experience about this degree and I did not find out anything about it.
        <br> Recently, when I get familiar and thanks to the support of teachers, tutors and my classmates, I think I nearly keep up with this course, especially the Graphic and Web design studio.<br>
        <br> I am also really a businesswoman so the next step that I am going to do after this assignment is creating my own busines website. I think I can do it.I am trying step by step and day by day to get progression.<br>
