                    <h2>Scope and strategy website</h2>
                    <p>The strategy of a website is mainly based on two items: website objectives and user needs.
                        The first step to creating a website is defining its website's objective. There are many
                        objectives for my website. First of all, it is a place to put all my works of the graphic and
                        design studio module on, so I would like to get a good mark on this subject. Secondly, this
                        website is a marketing tool for me. I mean, In here, I have planned to the public all my designs
                        as a public portfolio that will send to my teachers and my future employers to internship,
                        interview, and get a well-paid job. Therefore, my goal is to meet users' goals to evaluate my
                        ability and skills for their purposes.
                        Furthermore, it is my first website, so I have used it to practice to have a deeper
                        understanding of this module. Thanks to this, I can get a sense of satisfaction and enjoy this
                        progress. Finally, it reflects my process in class.
                        Part two of the strategic plan is to identify who are users and their needs. The first class of
                        my users that I would like to mention is my teacher. They are Mary Jackson( lecturer ) and Tom(
                        tutor), and my program leader. Moreover, I want to send this web to my classmates because I
                        think they will give me a lot of feedback to help me improve my skills and correct my mistakes.
                        I also want to introduce it to my family and my friends. Importantly, this website will be sent
                        to my potential employers as a public portfolio when I interview or apply for a job in the
                        future.
                        In terms of website scope, I will break it into two parts: functionality and content. So what I
                        want my website to do. It includes webpages, links to other pages, easy navigation, a usable
                        interface, flexible items and buttons. I want my website to present all information and choices.
                        Now I will talk about the content of my website. It has specific content like my information,
                        assignments of UX, design, typography and coding task and reflective report. Moreover, I would
                        put other information related to my contacts and other projects.</p>
